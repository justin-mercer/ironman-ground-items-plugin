# Ironman Ground Items

A RuneLite plugin that removes items you don't own from right-click menus. Perfect for Ironman accounts to avoid clicking on other players' drops that can't be taken.

## Features

- **Hide Other Player Items**: Automatically hides items dropped by other players from right-click menus (recommended for Ironman accounts)
- **Configurable Filtering**: Choose which types of items to hide based on ownership
- **Ironman Friendly**: Designed specifically to help Ironman players avoid accidentally clicking on items they cannot take
- **Performance Optimized**: Lightweight implementation that doesn't impact game performance

## Configuration Options

- **Hide Other Player Items**: Hide items dropped by other players (recommended for Ironman)
- **Hide Public Items**: Hide items that are public (no specific owner)
- **Hide Own Items**: Hide items that you dropped (not recommended)
- **Hide Group Items**: Hide items dropped by group members (for Group Ironman)

## How It Works

When you right-click on ground items, the plugin checks the ownership status and removes "Take" options from the menu for items that match your filter settings.

## For Ironman Players

This plugin is essential for Ironman accounts as it prevents the frustration of accidentally clicking on items you can't take. No more "You're an ironman, so you can't take this item" messages - those items simply won't appear in your right-click menu!
